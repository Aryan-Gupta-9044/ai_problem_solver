# ai_problem_solver
   # AI Problem Solvers Hub

   A collection of interactive AI algorithm implementations and visualizations for classic computer science problems.

   ## Included Solvers

   - **Wumpus World**: Navigate a dangerous cave to find gold using logical reasoning
   - **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**: Play against an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
   - **Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Visualize and compare search optimization techniques
   - **Cryptarithmetic Solver**: Solve letter-based math puzzles using constraint satisfaction

   ## Usage

   1. Clone this repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-problem-solvers.git
      ```

   2. Install required dependencies:
      ```
      pip install tkinter pillow
      ```

   3. Run the launcher:
      ```
      python ai_solver.py
      ```

   4. Alternatively, run any individual solver directly:
      ```
      python "wumpus demo4.py"
      ```

   ## Requirements

   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
   - PIL/Pillow library for some visualizations
